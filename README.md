In this project was passed the HTML source and we had, from it, to create a page that searches based on a term (singer/band, song or album), using the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/), and show the main tracks as options to create a playlist on your [Spotify account](https://open.spotify.com/).  

You can find the project deployed and running at [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), here is the [project deployed](https://loquacious-zuccutto-c58a58.netlify.app/).

## Be aware ##  

The first search may fail because I am using a free version of the API, and so, to connect to the API, a token request must be necessary, that happens when the first search is performed after you access the application.  

This app is quite useless, once you can access your Spotify account to create your own playlists, but this project was asked as part of the Full-Stack Engineer course to show all knowledge about using JavaScript, React and consuming API's.
